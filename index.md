# The Laverty Surname

Laverty is the anglicized form of an old Irish name written as “Ua Flaithbertach” (nominative) or “Ua Flaithbertaig” (genitive) in Old Irish and Middle Irish texts.

It is the name of one of the major native Irish clans, whose lineage derives from the Irish royal families. The surname is commonly translated as “bright ruler” or more correctly “bright prince”, flaith originally meaning prince in Irish. “O” or Ó comes from Ua, designating “grandson” or “descendant” of a (major) clan member. The prefix is often anglicised to O', using an apostrophe instead of the Irish síneadh fada. There are many incarnations of the original Irish name, including Flaherty, Flaharty, Fleharty, Flahrity, Fluharty, Flaverty, Faherty, Feherty, Fairty. Laverty and Lafferty are the Ulster forms of the Connacht name.

The clan motto is Fortuna Favet Fortibus, or “Fortune Favours the Brave”. The O'Flaherty coat of arms depicts 'two red lions rampant combatant, supporting a red dexter hand, couped at the wrists, in base a black boat with eight oars'. However there is little known of Irish heraldic tradition as compared to that of the English although Irish use of distinctive flags and banners in battle is recorded in Irish annals.

# Laverty Farm in Taylors Arm

My grandparents Leonard James Laverty and Elsie Pearl McGree lived on a farm in Taylors Arm and had 11 children, 6 boys and 5 girls.

<img src="photos/laverty-family-group-photo.jpg">

The farm was a dairy farm and dad would have to get up early to milk the cows.

Some photos from the farm :

# The Pub with No Beer

The Laverty farm is down the road from the famous "Pub With No Beer",

<img src="photos/taylors-arm-pub-with-no-beer.jpg">

The history of The Pub With No Beer dates back to 1943, when farmer Dan Sheahan went to the Day Dawn Hotel in Ingham, north of Queensland, only to find American soldiers had drunk the pub dry of beer.

With a glass of wine in hand instead, he penned the poem "A Pub Without Beer".

Country singer Gordon Parsons adapted the song to "A Pub With No Beer", basing it on his own local at Taylors Arm, then called the Cosmopolitan Hotel.

When his friend Slim Dusty recorded the song in 1957, it became an Australian chart-topper.

# Lavertys Bridge

In Taylors Arm is also the Laverty's Bridge.

Which according to the Taylors Arm Community facebook group occassionaly floods and goes under water.

<b>Lavertys Bridge flooded, 14 February 2020</b>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Construction of Lavertys Bridge

Apparently in 1909 there was great debate about the need for the construction of the Laverty Bridge, from :

Nambucca News (NSW : 1909 - 1911) View title info Fri 23 Jul 1909 - Page 3 - Shire Council Meeting.

<b>Laverty's Bridge.</b>

Cr. Wallace moved that the engineer call tenders for the construction of Laverty's Crossing Bridge. It was time that the work was commenced.

Cr. Dowle : The engineer's report is against it.

Cr. Lyon : The report says the crossing is good, and the bridge is hardly necessary.

Cr. Wallace : The report is correct. In fine weather the crossingis good. But the money is on the estimates, so the bridge must be constructed.

Cr. Lyon : I don't see there is any urgent necessity for it.

Cr. H. Lane seconded the motion. In his opinion the bridge was required, and every one in the district was in favor of it. In flood time the bridge would be required.

Cr. Lyon: We don't get floods now.

Cr. Lane : We have had our dry cycles, but in time the wet cycles will return, and then the bridge will be needed.

The President ; Certainly £500 were put on the estimates for the bridge.

Cr. Dowle : The money was placed on the estimates to get a report; That report is now to hand, and it states the bridge is not necessary. The report was adopted, so that put an end to the matter. Judging by the manner the councillors had just spoken, and especially Cr. Wallace, the Engineer was a man of great abilities, so they could not very well refuse to accept his report. To pass the motion would mean flying in the face of the report;

The President : Let the engineer prepare estimates for the bridge, and if it can be done for £500 it will be taken into consideration.

Cr. Wallace : Call tenders for it. That is the only way to get at the estimates. The engineer says nothing against it. The engineer explained that if a bridge was constructed over the crossing it would cost £1500, and if taken across from Laverty's paddock the cost would be about £900. The bridge would be about 350 feet long, and more over' the banks are very friable.

The President: We have not got the money at our disposal.

Cr. Moseley: It is not fair to the contractors to call for tenders just to get at the cost.

Cr. Lyon: The engineer has gone near enough to the cost to satisfy us.

Cr. Dowle : If we go outside the engineer's report, we will take the matters out of his hands.

Cr. Moseley said he was satisfied to accept the engineer's report, and if that report was against the bridge he did not see why it should be constructed.

Cr. Wallace pointed out that it was strange that Warrell Creek Bridge, which was far longer than than of Laverty's Creek, should cost only £900. In his opinion the Laverty's Creek Bridge could  be constructed for £500.

The Engineer: Warrell Creek Bridge is between 120 and 130 feet, whilst Laverty's Crossing Bridge would be fully 200 feet long.

Cr. Dowle: The banks are not safe, and the piles are likely to wash away at any time. On the motion of Cr. Wallace, the engineer was instructed to prepare detailed estimates for the bridge.

# Big is beautiful for family

The Laverty families were large in size, generations of Laverty's with 10 kids per family was not uncommon.

<img src="photos/big-is-beautiful.jpg">

Daily Examiner

THE DAILY EXAMINER, Monday, October 4, 1993.

Big is beautiful for family

GRAFTON'S Len and Elsie Laverty, (back left) were the surprised centres of attention at a family gathering planned for their 50th wedding anniversary by their 11 children.

Grand-children (from left) Aaron, Jason, Andrew, Alex, Melissa, Andrea and Michael were among the 50-odd Laverty family members celebrating the day. Large families may be old-fashioned but according to Mrs Laverty, they're a key to happiness. She says her 11 children have kept her young and her marriage healthy.

Now celebrating her 50th wed ding anniversary with her husband Len, she says the couple has always put the children first. Now her children have returned the compliment.

The family, including 22 grand children and one great-grand child, surprised the couple with an anniversary party on Saturday.

About 50 family members travelled to Grafton from as far afield as Queensland and Sydney for the special event.

# Laverty Family Reunions

The Laverty families have occassionaly held family reunion gatherings. I have been to two such reunions, one in Macksville Showground 1989 when I was about 4 years old, and a more recent one in at Grafton on 4th April 2015.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Laverty's came in their hundreds

<img src="photos/reunion-lavertys-came-in-their-hundreds.jpg" height="1000px">

Hundreds of descendants of the Laverty family flocked back to the Nambucca Valley recently for a family reunion. It was one of the many events held in the Nambucca Valley during the October long weekend.

The family, which has traced its roots back to landing in Australia from Ireland and England in about 1860, filled the Macksville Showground hall to overflow ing for the occasion.

The hall was decorated with Bambo ferns and hundreds of balloons fishing. nets. Old and new photographs adorning the walls. A photograph of the first house built at

Taylors Arm by a Laverty took pride of place on the stage. About 1000 Lavertys (including their wives and husbands) took part in the reunion, including one family group with 200 descendants.

They danced into the small hours to the music of Phillip Laverty and Gavin Kings' "True Blue" band.

The dancing finished at lam, and some were back at 6.30am to decorate the truck for Open Air Mass on Sunday morning.

### Lavert Reunion Starts Tomorrow

<img src="photos/reunion-laverty-reunion-starts-tomorrow.jpg">

One of the district's best known families, the Lavertys, are staging a family reunion at the Macksville Showground this

weekend. Organisers of the event are expecting about 1,000 Laverty descendants to attend the two day gathering, travellingfrom all states of Australia and from New Zealand

for the family's first reunion. Mrs Dot Clarke, one of the co- ordinators of the event, said the family's ancestors, Sarah and Michael Laverty, emigrated from County Down, or Limerick, in 1864.

They settled first at Pola Creek, outside Kempsey, before taking up land at Taylors Arm where they built the original family homestead and raised six children, An open air Mass will be celebrated at Michael, Dennis, John, Sam, Sarah and

Cathrine. Descendants populated the valley in quick time, branching out to Thumb Creek, Bowraville and Macksville, with many still living in the district.

Mrs Clarke said the original homestead planned for almost 12 months, inspired by at Taylors Arm was demolished in 1930 but a second, built near Lavertys Bridge in 1901, is still occupied by John and Lily Laverty.

ground at Ilam with registration, when visitors will have the chance to view the display of memorabilia and perhaps catch up with a few "long lost relatives".

Lunch will follow at noon, with a photograph session at 2.30pm and a barbecue dinner at 6pm.

Highlight of the weekend is expected to be tomorrow night's family concert and dance starting at 7.30pm, with the music led by True Blue and Brendan Laverty and his band.

During the evening presentations will be made to the eldest, youngest and longest married members of the family, along with the most recent married and the couple with the most children.

9.30am on Sunday by Fr Noel Rowe, whose mother was a Laverty, assisted by Fr Frank Gorman. This will be followed by mixed sports and games with lunch at noon.

Mrs Clark said the reunion had been

her research into the family which began in 1986. "It should be a wonderful weekend provided the weather holds off; we are all The reunion will open at the show- really looking forward to it," she said.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Laverty re-union

<img src="photos/reunion-laverty-reunion.jpg">

Is your name Laverty, or perhaps Lafferty or O'Laverty.

We are having a Family reunion at Macksville Showground, on Saturday 30th September and Sunday October 1st.

All you long lost cousins are invited to turn up. Dance to the local bands on Saturday night, after fun and games all day, Sunday morning there will be Open Air Mass, hopefully for about 1,000 Lavertys and their relations.

Our ancestors arrived here in the middle 1800, form Down, Downpatrick, Limerick in Ireland and first settled on the Macleay at Pola Creek, then selected land at Taylors Arm, Bowraville and later at

Macksville. Quite a few families still live on the land at Taylors Arm, and a large number at Macksville.

The Laverty name is well known on the Nambucca Valley. Our families married into the Chapman, Walton, Reibel, Cassin, Lynch, McGree, Foster, Clarke, Fuller, Rowe, McPherson, Ballard, Donnelly, Welsh, Hudson, just a few in our area.

Food and drink will be available on both days, so hopefully it will be a great week-end and in years to come, we can start a conversation, with "Remember our week-end at Macksville".

### Laverty reunion

The Laverty family whose obstinacy gave the area the separation of Upper and Lower Taylors Arm holds a reunion on Saturday and Sunday. Many of the family are still in the Macleay-Nambucca regions.

Others will travel from South Australia, Victoria and Queensland, and even from New Zealand for the reunion, to be held at the Macksville Showground.

An open air mass is planned at 9am on Sunday. The Laverty family, with a rather complicated family tree, has as its crest Fortune Favours the Brave but it is not known exactly why labourer, Michael Laverty fled Ballymyhinch, County Down, for England half way through last century.

Unusually for his time, he could read and write, and at Chiltern Moor, Cumberland, met and then married at Workington another Catholic, Sarah McCormick.

They and three children were assisted migrants when the St Hilda arrived at Port Jackson on February 4, 1865. A brother in law, Auguste Raymonde, was then living at Pola Creek.

Family records say they settled at Pola Creek, then (?) near Kinchela, but because of flooding moved to an area to become known as Laverty's Plains near Taylors Arm in 1884. A son, Dennis Laverty, born at Chiltern and five when they shipped for the colony, and his bride, Nora Goldspring, were to be the first couple married in the old Catholic Church on Wards Farm, the amorous suitor riding 80 miles (129km) to Orara near Coffs Harbour to do his courting. He selected his homestead, Oakvale, in 1883 and built his home in 1902.

Around the same time a John Laverty (Snr) selected land near the present Taylors Arm Hall. Sam Laverty, a son by a previous marriage of the immigrant Michael, had subsequently followed his father to Australia and selected across the river. When a milk factory was planned a site on Sam's farm was selected - but he refused to sell and the factory was moved to a site farther upstream to bring the separation of today's

Upper and Lower Taylor's Arm.

Adding further piquancy to the family tree,

Dennis Laverty's Nora was the daughter of an Elizabeth Donnelly (nee Robertson or Ribinson) who had married a John Goldspring - after first being married to a Michael Donnelly, producing two sons. She left her husband because of his drinking and following his death married Goldspring (an Irish builder and the son of a herring fisherman) who had travelled the world and a number of goldfields.

Family sources say the family was well off, but were forced to leave Ireland when "the i English confiscated their property, arriving in NSW via the USA.

A family book and other memorabilia will be on sale at the reunion.

### The McGree Brothers of Taylor’s Arm

https://www.storiesofoz.com/2017/11/11/the-mcgree-brothers-of-taylors-arm-2/

Posted on November 11, 2017 by gbarron

John, Michael and Patrick McGree were raised on their parents’ farm on the Mid-north coast of NSW. All three answered the call to arms in 1915. The ANZAC battalions were forming up, and the brothers were determined to have their chance at glory.

Their mother, Bridget Sullivan, had married Irishman James McGree in St Augustine’s Church, Longford, Tasmania in 1874. The young couple moved north and took up a selection on Hickey’s Creek near Kempsey. Life was tough, but like most good Catholics they welcomed children, bringing twelve boys and girls into the world over a twenty-five-year period.

Patrick, the oldest of the three McGree boys who served, was a born adventurer. He headed off to New Zealand at an early age, living in Waiapo and Gisborne. He kept in touch with his Australian family via mail and occasional visits.

In 1914, when war broke out, Patrick was 31 years old, yet he signed on with the Wellington Infantry, New Zealand Expeditionary Force. Michael crossed the Tasman Sea to join his brother, but was waylaid by an unscheduled love affair. He married his Kiwi girl, Nellie, just before heading off for intensive training in Egypt.

John, still at home on the farm outside Taylors Arm, was 22 when he joined up in 1915. He was a small, wiry man, weighing just 58 kg, and of average height. In fact, none of the McGree boys were tall, but were all as tough as nails, with brilliant blue eyes and Irish charm. The doctor examining Michael for his enlistment described him as having a “grand constitution.”

Patrick and Michael, though assigned to different units, both took their place amongst the bloody heroes of the ANZAC landings at Gallipoli. Both survived the early days of suicide charges on the well-entrenched Turks, but natural attrition took its toll. Patrick was killed on August 8, 1915, in the defence of a hill called Chunuk Bair.

<b>Nambucca and Bellinger New Fri Nov 26 1915</b>

<img src="photos/mcgree-brothers-taylors-arm-001.png">

Michael was wounded in the last days of the Gallipoli campaign, and was evacuated to the Fulham Military Hospital in England. His recuperation was slow, and he endured hospitalisation for almost six months before being returned to his unit, judged as fit to serve in the hellish trenches of France.

On the 28th of July 1916 that “tough little bastard” John McGree was one of thousands sent in human waves against the German trenches at the Battle of the River Somme. He was shot in the chest and back. He was still alive when he reached the field hospital, but died within twenty-four-hours. He was buried at the nearby Warloy-Baillon Military Cemetery.

<b>McGree death</b>

<img src="photos/mcgree-brothers-taylors-arm-002.png">

James and Bridget received the usual telegram from Base Records in Melbourne informing them of John’s death: a message just fourteen words long. Losing one son was hard enough. The loss of a second must have been hard to bear.

Bridget penned a desperate letter back to Base Records.

<b>McGree Bridget's Letter</b>

<img src="photos/mcgree-brothers-taylors-arm-003.png">

Dear Sir

Please could you give me any information about the death of my son Pte John A McGree No. 3888, who died of wounds in France …  I would like to know the name of the hospital where he died, also if he was seriously wounded or what caused his death. What were his last words and where is he buried? Please send reply as soon as possible

B. McGree,

Taylor’s Arm, via Macksville

Five months passed before she received any additional information: a kind letter informing her of the nature of John’s wounds and the name of the hospital and cemetery. John’s personal effects also arrived in the mail: one religious medallion, three handkerchiefs, two brushes, a cap comforter, one photograph and a notebook.

<img src="photos/mcgree-brothers-taylors-arm-004.png">

By July 1918, the surviving brother, Michael McGree, was a veteran of three years of the most terrible warfare mankind had ever known. On the morning of July 18, 1918, just months before the end of the war, his company were ordered to attack a fortified German trench at Gommecourt Wood, France. Running into a hail of lead, Michael was killed in action, just a few kilometres away from the site of his brother John’s death, two years earlier.

Their father, James McGree died at the age of 86, in 1928. Bridget lived on until she was 87, a highly respected local pioneer, and a matriarch of the Laverty, Brock, and McGree families. She died in 1940 and was buried in Macksville cemetery.

The strength she must have had to shoulder the grief of three lost sons is a testament to the spirit of not just the Anzacs, but their families.

### War Time Mystery Leads Two Men to Taylors Arm

<img src="photos/war-time-mystery-leads-two-men-to-taylors-arm.jpg">

Official Presentation Brings Search to an End
Regular readers of the Mid-Coast Observer may remember a number of articles on two photographs taken during World War One of brothers Patrick and John McGree.

The search for identity of the brothers led two men - Michael Long from England and Melbourne's David Sandground - on a world-wide search, eventually ending in the small farming village of Taylors Arm.

Two stories were run in this paper, asking anyone who knew the identity of the young men to come forward. And it worked.

The two men received numerous calls from people who were related to, or knew of the McGree boys. Taylors Arm Sub-Branch members also offered their assistance.

And on October 3, the photographs will take their rightful place during an official presentation to be held at noon.

Taylors Arm Sub-Branch members are now completing arrangements for Mr Sandground to hand over these unique pieces of wartime history to members of the McGree family.

The presentation will coincide with another special event in Taylors Arm history - the unveiling and dedication of a plaque to those who gave their lives to our country.

All relatives, friends and interested people are invited to attend this historical event. Organisers expect a large attendance of neighbouring sub branch members to witness the occasion.

### Planning Begins for McGree Photo Presentation

Planning begins for McGree photo presentation

The mysterious saga of a photograph taken during World War One has almost reached its heart-warming finale.

Current custodians of the photograph, Melbourne resident David Sandground and Michael Long of England, have spent the past year tracking down its rightful owners - the McGree family of Taylors Arm. And now it is finally coming back to our shores.

Taylors Arm RSL Sub-Branch President Barry Fuller has spoken with David about involving the official presentation of the photograph to the McGree family in the unveiling of the new Taylors Arm cenotaph plaque around September or October.

A small mention of the famous Pub with no Beer was all it took for David to agree, and he is now trying to get Michael to travel from England to attend the unveiling and presentation.

Taylors Arm's small but hardworking sub-branch are now in the process of up-dating the cenotaph with names of those who served in World War One and Two, and also more recent conflicts.

Following are the names gathered from honour rolls at Taylors Arm and Burrapine halls. Please con tact Barry on 6564 2206 if you know of any names which should be listed.

### McGree Family Truly Upheld ANZAC Spirit

<img src="photos/mcgree-family-truly-upheld-anzac-spirit.jpg">

McGree family truly upheld ANZAC Spirit

If ANY family understood the sacrifices of ANZAC was the McGrees of Taylors Arm. James and Bridget McGree sent four sons to World War I yet only one came home. How deep and profound must their sorrow have been? There was mourning on both sides of the Tasman for the McGrees as two of their boys were killed action fighting for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF).

The Taylors Arm War Memorial situated against serene backdrop of rolling tree covered hills and in children's playground.... stark contrast to bloody battlefields of Gallipoli and Western Front.

The McGree brothers' names are also on cenotaph Bowraville. Patrick Joseph McGree, born 1883, enlisted at Taruheru, Gisborne, and was killed August 8, 1915. He fell Chunuk Bair, the highest point ANZACS reached Gallipoli and where today impressive stone monument records names more than 800 officers men of NZEF who died 1915 and who have known grave, including the brave boy from Taylors Arm.

John Ambrose McGree, born 1892, signed on for duty with Australian Imperial Force just 18 days after Patrick had fallen and left Australia with the Infantry Battalion, 1 Reinforcements, five days after Christmas 1915 aboard HMAT Medic.

The 22-year-old's enlistment papers describe him as fit with "fresh. complexion", good eyesight, 5 feet inches (174 centimetres) tall and 126 pounds (57 kilograms)-in other words, young, lean and keen-ideal attributes for soldier. John stepped ashore Alexandria on March 29, 1916 and then went straight to the front, disembarking Marseilles six days later. Taken on strength into the Battalion at Étaples, John sustained gunshot wounds to the back chest on July 25,1916 and, sadly, died of his wounds the next day. He was buried Warloy-Baillon Military Cemetery in the Somme by war chaplain, Reverend Samuel J Gosling. A heartbroken Mrs McGree wrote to Army Base Records in Melbourne on August 29 asking for details of his death and burial and if anyone knew "what were his last words".

On July 18, 1918, Michael Dennis McGree, born 1890, was killed in action in France whilst fighting for the NZEF and buried in Gommecourt Wood New Cemetery, Foncquevillers. At the time, Michael was reported as missing action. While awaiting news about his fate, McGree fractured a rib in a sulky accident and was taken to Kempsey Hospital. She suffered more pain than mother should bear.

REMEMBERED: The McGree brothers are named on the War Memorials at both Taylors Arm. (top) and Bowraville (below). inscribed

## Utungun Taylors Arm WW1 Honor Roll

TAYLORS ARM FIRST WORLD WAR HONOR ROLL

DESCRIPTION
The Honor Roll is a large memorial consisting of a slab of marble mounted on a classically designed timber frame. It was reburbished with an Anzac Centenary Grant.

A Taylors Arm Reception Committee was formed by April 1921 and steps were taken to erect a Roll in the Taylors Arm Hall. The secretary was instructed to obtain prices from various firms as well as advice on the style of the monument. The Nambucca and Bellinger News on 6 May 1921 reported an order had been placed with Harvey and Son, Kempsey. At that stage 44 names had been received.

Ten months later, on 24 February 1922, they published a letter from Clem Sanders, a Nambucca Heads businessman explaining the reason for the delay in unveiling the Roll. Mr Sanders and Mr C. Johnson were charged with coordinating the work. It was now in the hands of Harvey and Son and expected to be completed in a week or two. The marble slab was to cost £50 and at that stage was to contain over seventy names. The first meeting to plan an unveiling had proved unsuccessful and he appealed for attendees to express interest, so the event could be arranged.

## German Ancestry

One thing I found interesting was that my grand mother Elsie had german ancestry via the following path way :

Elsie Pearl McGree --> Ethel Stella Cook --> Alfred Henry Cook --> Johan Peter Koch

## The Cooks of Stuarts Point

<img src="photos/the-cooks-of-stuarts-point.jpg">

This history begins in 1853 on May 3rd when Peter Koch (Cook) arrived in Australia on the ship "Droden" from Germany with his wife Anna Catherine (Schroder). He was 25 years old and he and Anna brought with them a baby son Franz (Frank) who was born on 20 Th September 1852 in Wallstadt, Germany. Both of Peter's parents, George and Elizabeth were deceased as was Anna's father Jaco but her mother, Catharina was still alive

The date of the Cook's arrival at Stuart's Point is not yet precisely known They would have traveled up the coast by sailing vessel or steamer either to the Macleay or to Port Macquarie and thence onto the Macleay. An application to establish a Public School at Yarr happini in 1880 bears the signature of Peter Cook as being on a committee of seven residents seeking education for their children. At that time Peter and Anna had 12 children but only the last five were young enough to attend school. In March of 1883 the school opened with 21 students enrolled. The first teacher was James Harvey who was 21 and who had no formal training as a teacher but would have spent some weeks in a large school learning the system

In 1883 the Kirkwood brothers opened a sawmill at Stuart's Point and a village soon started to grow around the mill Stuart's Point got it's own Public School in 1899 and this y t would have seen many of the descendants of Peter and Anna attending. The first teacher, Henry Peck from Wagga Wagga was not impressed with conditions at the Point.

"I have an inferior residence one and a quarter miles from school. That distance I have to trudge knee-deep in sand in all weathers I am 26 miles from store, church, doctor etc. and no steamer or coach to reach Kempsey Sometimes my family are without beef for a fortnight, and when supplied it is hardly fit for human consumption Further it is not convenient to keep a horse as there is no grass within miles of the Point. This is the home of Death Adders snakes and sandflies, also the dingo, but few people"

This gives a little insight to conditions at Stuart's Point in the 19th century. Although another sawmill opened in 1886, the work was intermittent and the families were poor, Peter is known to have been a farmer, lay Methodist Minister and a Vine Dresser. It is not known if he worked at the mill He was best known as caretaker of the North Coast Co's shed and wharf at Stuart's Point He was naturalized on 27/Aug/1878 Anna was a midwife at Stuart's Point

Peter died in 1909 and his death is recorded in an article from a local newspaper at the time which states he was a very old colo nist It continues "Peter Cook who died at his residence at Stuart's Point on Friday night last week. The deceased gentleman was well-known not only in the Maclery District, but also the Nambucca and Bellinger. He succumbed to heart failure following kidney disease and his death was rather sadden No one in the vicinity of Stuart's Point was more highly respected than "Grandfather Cook" as he was affectionately termed by both young and old. A Native of Germany the late Mr. Cook was 84 years of age, but he was in all respects except in regard to place of birth an Australian, as he had resided in NSW for nearly 60 years and was intintensely proud of his adopted land. Deceased was

## John Cook Reports Stolen Grog

John P. Cook, caretaker at the wharf, deposed that the goods were kept locked up in the store; there were casks of grog there, which were consigned to Mr Dan Guiney;
witness looked at them on the Saturday and aon Sunday between 5 and 6; there was nothing wrong then; about 10 or 11 on Monday morning he went down to the store and found some boards had been removed; on unlocking the door and going inside he found one of the casks pulled away from where it had stood, and a case had been shifted; a hole had been bored in teh cask; he shook it, there was a smell, but he did not know what it was; had to shove teh cask and roll it along the best way he could; he never had his hand on it until he found the hole in it; was there when it was put in the store.

## Elsie Pearl Laverty (McGree) Eulogy

EULOGY
Today as we remember and give thanks for the life of our mother, it is impossible to remember her without mentioning our father also.

Throughout the 54 years of their married life, they were totally committed to each other and their children -they prayed together every night of those 54 years.

This was a tremendous source of grace to them- and to each of their 11 children.

Since the death of my father-four years ago-my mother experienced her own personal brokenness, from which she never really fully recovered.

Like Mary, the mother of Jesus, my mother was a gentle woman of Taith, one who pondered many things in her heart..

In a group, she was generally quiet, reserved and discreet in her conversations.

"She was gifted with tremendous goodness and generosity.She played an important role in the ministry at 211 Dobie St. where for the last eight years she cooked many wonderful cakes, pies and biscuits for the inmates at the correctional centre and their families when they came to visit .On Tuesday, as I thanked her for all she had done, she responded by saying, "I loved doing it"...

Her greatest love was for her family.

Her husband, children, grandchildren and greatgrand children

meant everything to her.

She has left behind her, 11 unfinished masterpieces in her children and I'm sure she would envisage that her children would continue the legacy she and my father instilled in us during their parenting,

Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous...It is not rude, it does not seek its own interests-It bears all things, hopes all things, endures all things... Love never fails..

May she rest in peace.

EULOGY
Leonard James Laverty, the son of Dennis and Nora Laverty, was gifted with life on 10th October, 1911.

Sixty-eight years of his life, was spent on the family farm at Taylors Arm on the Nambucca River. It was during his many years of being close to the earth that he developed a deep respect and love for the land, for nature and life itself...

Dad was the first to introduce us to God as the Giver of Life...

He used our life experiences, the plants and animals to open up for us the meaning of life, birth, growth and death.

He enabled us to become aware of the place of gentleness, patience and hope in

dealing with life around us and with ourselves.

My father lived a simple and unpretentious kind of life he worked with dignity and effort, always treating others honestly and generously. For many years, when we lived in Taylor's Arm, my father took great pride in his vegetable garden. He was very generous in sharing the fruits of his labours with others and was sensitive to those less fortunate than himself.

On many occasions, we recall, taking vegetables, fruit, farm produce to school for

the Sisters at the Macksville convent and also for our Parish Priest. Our understanding and awareness of our oneness with others developed from the generosity shown by Dad.

At the age of 19, in 1930, my father joined two of his brothers and formed a "Laverty's Band". This band proved to be very popular at a lot of dances and balls on the Nambucca River which included Bowraville, Missabotti. Talarm,

Utungan, Burrapine, South Arm and the surrounding areas. Dad was very versatile in the band - on some occasions he accompanied his

brother Denny - a violinist - by vamping on the plano....

His official capacity in the band was as a competent drummer; soloist and MC. He also entertained the audience with a "flexi-tone" for waltzes and a "swance whistle" which is similar to a slide trombone.

Dad's love of music was evident in our family life. Many family gatherings, outings and reunions saw my father entertaining the relatives and friends with recitals on the mouth organ, the piano accordian, Jew's harp. I recall when he was rostered with my mother on the church cleaning at Taylor's Arm- Mum always cared for the Altar, the linen and flowers. Dad's job was to clean the body of the Church. He quickly moved through the Church (without lifting or moving any furniture) - then he serenaded to Mum on the organ - playing all his old favourites....

I think it would be true to say his favourite instruments were the spoons... (he often played the spoons whilst we waited for dessert to be served - much to Mum's

horror!!) Throughout our family life, we have been blessed to have Dad always there for us.

Together, as a family, we have worked through times of grief, brokenness, and the

pain of separation in relationships. There have been some occasions when my father struggled with his desires and expectations for his children. He sometimes found his values and beliefs differed

from his childrens...

But, having the openness and freedom within himself to work through this struggle, he came to accept the uniqueness and differences in his eleven children. He was able to give them the space and time to follow their own direction in

life....continue to love them and be there for them. We will always remember Dad for his wonderful sense of humour...

In December 1992, we buried Dad's last brother, John, and afterwards as we shared a cup of tea, many people spoke to Dad, offering their sympathy and several asked Dad if "he was the last in the family" - to which Dad said "Yes" - and they replied. "Well, you take very good care of yourself, Len". Later I came along to sit with him for awhile and he commented on what people had said to him. I said, well how do you feel Dad, being the last one in the family? He replied - I feel like an "endangered species!! I must add he used to play on being an "endangered species" when Mum wanted some jobs done around the house....!

Only recently, on Monday 2nd June, Dad and I were at the doctors surgery. waiting for our turn... Dad turned to and remarked. "You know you can die of old age, waiting at the doctor's ...." and on another occasion he commented. "You could catch six diseases and get over them while you're waiting here.."

Being a great man of deep faith, his greatest love has been for His God and his Church. His loving relationship with his maker, has been evident in his. faithfulness in praying the rosary, receiving the Sacraments and His living of the Word. Being in communion with his God, enabled Dad to be in a state of readiness when the Son of Man invited him to

"Come, you whom my Father has blessed, take for your heritage, the kingdom prepared for you since the foundation of the world.

May He rest in peace...

(Matt 25-34)
